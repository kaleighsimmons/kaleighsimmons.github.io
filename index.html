		<p>Hi guys, I’m Kaleigh. Perpetually nosy. Naturally curious. And love to write. I’m a 2008 graduate of the Newhouse School, classically trained in Broadcast Journalism but took a turn right out of college into marketing and freelance writing and haven't looked back since.</p>
			<p>I'm currently a student at Startup Institute Chicago, learning to couple my creative background with the technical expertise needed to succeed as an early stage employee at a growing startup business. Stay tuned!</p></body>
